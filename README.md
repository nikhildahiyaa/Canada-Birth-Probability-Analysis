# 🇨🇦 Canada Birth Probability Analysis (2000–2020)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project was completed as part of a technical exercise for a **Data and System Analyst** position. The objective was to analyze publicly available data to determine the **probability that a person born in a given year was born in Canada**, and to **explore trends in Canada's birth rate** over time.

---

## 🧪 Goal

- Retrieve global **birth rate** and **population** data per country per year
- Estimate **number of births per country per year**
- Store the cleaned data in a **SQLite database**
- Calculate the **probability of being born in Canada**, both for a selected year (2010) and across all years from 2000–2020
- Forecast Canada's birth rate up to 2030 using **regression models**
- Present findings with **clear visualizations and interpretations**

## 🔗 Data Sources

- 🌍 [Birth rate (World Bank)](https://api.worldbank.org/v2/country/all/indicator/SP.DYN.CBRT.IN?format=json)
- 👥 [Population (World Bank)](https://api.worldbank.org/v2/country/all/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL?format=json)

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, Requests, SQLite, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- SQLite for structured querying
- Jupyter Notebook for development and presentation

## 📊 Key Results

### Probability of Being Born in Canada
- In **2010**, the probability of being born in Canada was **0.0258%**
- Over the 2000–2020 period, the probability remained stable between **0.0235% and 0.0263%**
- **Peak year:** 2008, with the highest global birth share for Canada

### Birth Rate Forecast
- A **linear regression model** predicted the birth rate in 2030 will be **approximately 10.0 births per 1,000 people**
- Historical trend shows a steady decline since 2008
- Model:  
  \[
  \text{Birth Rate} = 84.859 - 0.0369 \times \text{Year}
  \]

## 📈 Visualizations

Charts are saved in the `output/` folder and include:

- `canada_birth_probability_trend.png`: Probability of being born in Canada (2000–2020)
- `canada_vs_world_births_split.png`: Estimated births in Canada vs. globally
- `canada_birth_rate_trend.png`: Birth rate trend in Canada
- `canada_population_trend.png`: Population growth in Canada
- `canada_birth_rate_forecast.png`: Forecast of Canada’s birth rate to 2030

---

## 🧠 Insights & Interpretation

- Canada's global share of births has been consistent despite population growth
- Birth rate decline mirrors patterns in other high-income countries due to urbanization, delayed parenthood, and socio-economic factors
- If trends continue, Canada may face **demographic challenges** including a shrinking labor force and increased aging dependency
